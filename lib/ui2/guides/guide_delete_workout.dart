// GUIDE #6: delete a workout.

//   Activity tab  ->  sub-tab "History"  ->  the bin icon at the end of the
//   session's row  ->  a confirm dialog (not framed; the first footer says what
//   confirming does).
//
// There is no delete on a session's summary: the bin is an icon with only a
// semantics label (workout_screen.dart:1113). The row shows it only for a
// session with an id. With several sessions the label is several controls: the
// target is the topmost bin (firstLabel; a plain label was ambiguous). One
// 'any' variant.
