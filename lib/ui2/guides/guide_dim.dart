// GUIDE DIM SCOPE: the seam through which a guide run tells the app's own
// components how to draw themselves, so the dim and the skeleton are part of the
// SAME widget subtree as the content. That way they scroll, fling and
// overscroll-stretch with it, in every frame (owner design, 2026-11-14).
//
//  * [GuideDimScope] sits once at the app root. Its [GuideDimController] holds the
//    plan: which component is dimmed, which is skeleton.
//  * `Surface`, `Section` and `Pressable` (grammar.dart) wrap themselves in
//    [GuideUnitMark] (../skeleton/unit_paint.dart), which asks the plan at PAINT
//    time and paints its own foreground. Loose text inside a scrollable is painted
//    by [GuideScrollBehavior]'s layer, inside the scrollable and its overscroll
//    stretch.
//  * The overlay (live_guide_overlay.dart) computes the plan and writes it with
//    [GuideDimController.setLooks]; it keeps the card, outline, pill, scroll marker
//    and per-layer hit testing, and paints only what no component paints itself.
//
// CLAIM(dim-in-tree): a component painted under a plan paints its own dim in the
// frame it moves in [guide_r2_scroll_dim_test, guide_r2_structural_test].
// CLAIM(dim-notifies-on-change): the controller notifies only when the plan changed
// [guide_r2_structural_test 'plan equality'].
