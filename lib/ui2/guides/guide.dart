// GUIDE MODEL (phase 2)
//
// A guide is data: where it starts, its steps (each a target on one of the
// user's REAL screens), and its footers. The live overlay walks the user's own
// screens along it. Nothing here builds a screen; review renders on demo data
// are test tooling (test/support/guide_view.dart) and keep their own map from
// step id to demo screen.
